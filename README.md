2. ADO.NET
3. CRUD Operations

Download this repository and open it in Visual Studio. Then create the database and teachers table in it. Finally change the connection string given inside the appsetting.json file and you are set to go:

```
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\MSSQLLocalDB;Database=School;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
  }
}
```


# How to create Teacher table
